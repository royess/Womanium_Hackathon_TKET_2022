    "Transpilation is the process of rewriting a given input circuit to match the topology of a specific quantum device and/or to optimize the circuit for execution on present-day noisy quantum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rewriting quantum circuits to match hardware constraints and optimizing for performance can be far from trivial. Most circuits must undergo a series of transformations that make them compatible with a given target device and optimize them to reduce the effects of noise on the resulting outcomes. The flow of logic in the rewriting toolchain need not be linear and can often have iterative sub-loops, conditional branches, and other complex behaviors. \n",

    "In this short demonstration, I want to show you the difference transpiler passes can make in circuit optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a sample chemistry-inspired quantum circuit obtained from the the Jordan-Wigner Mapper for computing the ground state energy of H$_2$. This 4-qubit circuit is a deep circuit. It has 150 gates, 86 layers, and 56 Xnot gates (CX)."
