# Qiantinuum's TKET challenge for the Womanium Hackathon

On behalf of Quantinuum, welcome to the Womanium Hackathon! This little guide should get you started quickly in `pytket`, a high-performance Python library for building and simplifying quantum programs.

TKET is the leading open-source developer toolkit designed to compile and optimize quantum programs. It is platform agnostic allowing it to target the worldâ€™s leading quantum hardware and simulators. It also enhances the performance of every Quantinuum product, including cybersecurity key-generation platform Quantum Origin, quantum computational chemistry and materials science package InQuanto, and lambeq, Quantinuum's quantum natural language processing and computational linguistics toolkit. 

If any questions arise during the hackathon, don't hesitate to contact me:

The content of this hackathon manual is as follows:
1) Getting ready with `pytket`
2) Running a circuit on IBM's backends
